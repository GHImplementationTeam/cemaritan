"""
The HMIS data standard includes logic for setting values in certain fields based 
on the values or non-values in other fields. This logic is depenendent on the field 
values once they are transformed from the source vocabulary to the HMIS vocabulary 
and mapped from source fields to HMIS fields. Thus, this logic is source independent 
and is applied only after all the source to HMIS mapping and translations have occurred. 
Thus, the code to apply this logic can be written once and used for all data conversions 
regardless of the source.

Currently throwing error, but should eventually log out the errors for bad data.

Printing a warning where the HMIS logic is unclear. Need to get clarification 
on what to do in that situation.
